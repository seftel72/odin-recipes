            <li>Spread a third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers two more times, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and cheese.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the chopped parsley on top.</li>
