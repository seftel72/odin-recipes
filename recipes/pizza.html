        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>STEPS:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Tear the fresh basil leaves and scatter them over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle minced garlic evenly on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle olive oil over the pizza, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven, or place the baking sheet in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute before slicing and serving.</li>
